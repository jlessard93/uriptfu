        <p>
            The PTFU continuously works toward our mission and commitment of
            addressing matters that directly impact both individual and collective areas of
            concern to URI/Part-Time Faculty. The PTFU goals include giving a voice to
            URI’s Part-Time Faculty, empowering them as equal members of URI’s
            teaching community, ensuring that members’ rights and entitlements gained
            from collective bargaining negotiations are respected and enforced. We will
            continuously work towards enhancing the work experience and environment
            for the Part-Time Faculty and continue to seek employment necessities, salary,
            equity and time in service rights. We strive to achieve these goals by leading
            and growing a sustainable and unified union group with a view towards
            advancing the status of URI’s Part-Time Faculty.
